# 🌟 BrewDog Catalogue  
This is a React-based beer search app powered by the Punk API. It allows users to search beers by name and view a brief summary of each result. I built this to practice API integration, routing, and component-driven UI design.

## ✨ Features  
- Users can search for a beer  
- Users can view details for specific beers  
- Users can view featured products on the home page  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- React  
- React Router 
- TypeScript
